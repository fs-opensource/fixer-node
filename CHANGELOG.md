## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- tba.


## [2.0.0](https://github.com/fs-opensource/fixer-node/compare/v1.0.0...v2.0.0) - 2018-05-16
The breaking change from `1.0` to `2.0` is that all methods accept an object as parameter
instead of individual parameters. This allows you to pass the parameters of interest.

**Example:**

```js
// request latest rates for a given base rate

// before:
// the first param is "symbols", but we don't necessarily want to specify it
const latest = fixer.latest(undefined, 'USD')

// now:
// add "symbols: 'EUR, AUD'" if you wish, but not necessary
const latest = fixer.latest({ base: 'USD' })
```
